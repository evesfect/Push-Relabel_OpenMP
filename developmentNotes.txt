Parallel version without any OpenMP flags (single thread- same code), x0.85 speed
x0.7 speedup (slowdown) with Baumstark phased approach compared to FIFO event though parallelized!
Baumstark paper heavily relies on efficient Global Heuristics and the rest seems inferior.
Starting from again: Adding Global Relabeling to seq FIFO.
x45 speedup with Global Heuristics compared to default FIFO (sequential testing)
Global Relabeling parallel almost x200 speedup compared to standard FIFO
Gap Relabeling seems too complicated. Only Global Relabel for sequential final version. Maybe gap if there is time left?
Problems with push relabel parallelization, too much atomic/contention?
Profiling results: push takes majority time, cannot get correct results when parallelized. Start again.
Simple parallelization with atomic discharge. Also used critical section for actives. Good Speedup but only at large graphs.
Testing takes too much time, correct push relabel parallel versions asap and write report!
Add final test comparing all versions FIFO, FIFO(GR), Parallel(GR), Parallel(Active)
